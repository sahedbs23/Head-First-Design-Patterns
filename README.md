## Design Principles

1. ### `STRATEGY` Design Pattern.

   The strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

   1. Identify the aspects of your application that `very` and `separate them` from what `stays the same`. Page 9

   2. Page 11: Program to an `Interface`, not an `Implementation`

   3. Favor `composition` over `Inheritance`
       1. Reference Page 23
2. ### `The Observer Pattern` 
    The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of it's dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   1. `Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.`
